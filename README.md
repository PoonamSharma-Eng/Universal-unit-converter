**Universal Unit Converter**

This is a Python-based utility I built for my hackathon to handle basic unit conversions. It’s designed to be simple, fast, and crash-proof.

**What it does:**

**Length:** Converts Kilometers to Miles

**Temperature:** Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit

**Weight:** Converts Kilograms to Pounds

It also checks if the user has entered a valid number to avoid errors.

**How to use it:**

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Run the command: python converter.py

Choose the conversion type and enter your value.
